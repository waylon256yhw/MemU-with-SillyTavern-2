from memu import MemuClient
```

**Step 3:** Quick Start
```python
# Initialize
memu_client = MemuClient(
    base_url="https://api.memu.so", 
    api_key=os.getenv("MEMU_API_KEY")
)
memu_client.memorize_conversation(
    conversation=conversation_text, # Recommend longer conversation (~8000 tokens), see https://memu.pro/blog/memu-best-practice for details
    user_id="user001", 
    user_name="User", 
    agent_id="assistant001", 
    agent_name="Assistant"
)
```

### Memory as file system

#### **Organize** - Autonomous Memory File Management
Your memories are structured as intelligent folders managed by a memory agent. We do not do explicit modeling for memories. The memory agent automatically decides what to record, modify, or archive. Think of it as having a personal librarian who knows exactly how to organize your thoughts.

#### **Link** - Interconnected Knowledge Graph
Memories don't exist in isolation. Our system automatically creates meaningful connections between related memories, building a rich network of hyperlinked documents and transforming memory discovery from search into effortless recall.

#### **Evolve** - Continuous Self-Improvement
Even when offline, your memory agent keeps working. It generates new insights by analyzing existing memories, identifies patterns, and creates summary documents through self-reflection. Your knowledge base becomes smarter over time, not just larger.

#### **Never Forget** - Adaptive Forgetting Mechanism
The memory agent automatically prioritizes information based on usage patterns. Recently accessed memories remain highly accessible, while less relevant content is deprioritized or forgotten. This creates a personalized information hierarchy that evolves with your needs.

## üò∫ Advantages

### Higher Memory Accuracy
MemU achieves 92.09% average accuracy in Locomo dataset across all reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming competitors. Technical Report will be published soon!

![Memory Accuracy Comparison](assets/benchmark.png)
<em>(1) Single-hop questions require answers based on a single session; (2) Multi-hop questions require synthesizing information from multiple different sessions; (3) Temporal reasoning questions can be answered through temporal reasoning and capturing time-related data cues within the conversation; (4) Open-domain knowledge questions can be answered by integrating a speaker‚Äôs provided information with external knowledge such as commonsense or world facts; </em>

### Fast Retrieval

We categorize important information into documents, and during retrieval, we only need to find the relevant document content, eliminating the need for extensive embedding searches for fragmented sentences.

### Low cost

We can process hundreds of conversation turns at once, eliminating the need for developers to repeatedly call memory functions, thus saving users from wasting tokens on multiple memory operations. See [best practice](https://memu.pro/blog/memu-best-practice).
