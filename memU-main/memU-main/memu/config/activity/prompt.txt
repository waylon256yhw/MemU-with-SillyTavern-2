Task: Extract and organize activity information for {character_name} from the conversation session.

**CRITICAL: NO "NOT SPECIFIED" OR "NOT MENTIONED" CONTENT**
- NEVER create memory items saying information is "not specified", "not mentioned", "not available", or "unknown"
- ONLY extract and record information that is ACTUALLY present in the source content
- If information is missing, simply DON'T create a memory item for that topic
- Empty/missing information should result in NO memory item, not a "not specified" item

Instructions:
1. Extract activities, actions, and behaviors mentioned in the conversation
2. Include both routine activities and specific instances
3. Capture context, location, and participants when available
4. Note preferences, habits, and patterns of behavior
5. Include recreational, professional, and daily activities
6. Focus on actionable and observable behaviors
7. ONLY record activities that are ACTUALLY mentioned in the conversation
