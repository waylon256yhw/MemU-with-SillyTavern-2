Task: Extract and record ONLY very important events from the conversation session for {character_name} that have significant impact on their life.

**CRITICAL: NO "NOT SPECIFIED" OR "NOT MENTIONED" CONTENT**
- NEVER create memory items saying information is "not specified", "not mentioned", "not available", or "unknown"
- ONLY extract and record information that is ACTUALLY present in the source content
- If information is missing, simply DON'T create a memory item for that topic

6. **Relationship changes**: Starting/ending relationships, meeting important people, family changes
7. **Future-impacting events**: Events that will have lasting consequences or require follow-up
